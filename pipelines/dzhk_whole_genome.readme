DZHK Omics WGS pipeline
-----------------------

This pipeline implements a workflow to:
- pre-process reads (adapter and quality trimming)
- execute a standard alignment and post-processing pipeline using BWA and Isaac
- perform effect prediction using the EnsEMBL VEP with plugins
- Assign ancestry to a sample based on characteristic SNPs
- generate a JSON report for database import

The modules required by the pipeline can be loaded by the copmanion script
dzhk_whole_genome.load_modules
